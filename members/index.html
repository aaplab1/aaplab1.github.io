She subsequently did an M.A. in ESL Pedagogy in a program that combined linguistics, sociolinguistics and pedagogy coursework, which solidified her interest in second language acquisition and led to her entering the interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Second Language Acquisition and Teaching (GIDP SLAT). Her linguistic interests revolve around English as a Second or Foreign Language, Lao and other tone languages. Currently, Karen in working on her dissertation, which examines intonational production in English by native speakers of Mandarin Chinese.

<li><p>Mark Amengual is a Ph.D. candidate in the Hispanic Linguistics Program at the University of Texas at Austin. He received his B.A. in English Philology from the Universitat de les Illes Balears, Majorca (Spain), and his M.A in Hispanic Linguistics from The Pennsylvania State University. His research interests involve bilingual speech production and perception, language contact and laboratory approaches to phonology. His dissertation examines cross-linguistic influence in the production and perception of highly proficient early Spanish-Catalan bilinguals. In addition to his research duties, he enjoys playing and coaching tennis, traveling, live music and breakfast tacos.</p></li>
<li><p>Brian Funk is a Master’s student in the Hispanic Linguistics Program at the University of Arizona Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He received his B.A. from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His research interests are centered on using psycholinguistic methods to study language structure, language use, and language development. For example, he is using psycholinguistic methods in the Lab to document the acoustics of a non-standard, informal style of Spanish spoken in the US Southwest as part of his Master’s thesis, directed by professor Miquel Simonet. A fundamental goal of his research is to better understand how the brain and the mind work together to establish meaning and understanding through language.</p></li>
<li><p>Marta Ramírez was born in the city of Palma, Majorca, Spain and has lived in Madrid (Spain), London (England) and Austin (Texas). She received her B.A. in English Philology from the University of the Balearic Islands, Spain. She is currently working towards her M.A. in Spanish Linguistics at the University of Arizona. Her linguistic interests fall within sociolinguistics, phonetics and syntax. Her M.A. thesis explores variation in the perception and production of palatal laterals and palatal fricatives in Majorcan Catalan and is directed by professor Miquel Simonet.</p></li>
<li><p>Miriam Díaz grew up in the town of Zarautz, in the Basque Country.

Carvalho. Miriam&#39;s research interests include the acquisition of the sound systems of second and third languages, the interrelation between L2 speech perception and production, the development of L1, L2 and L3 phonetic categorization, cross-linguistic speech perception and production, and multilingualism and phonetics in general. She is currently Assistant Professor of Hispanic Linguistics at Concordia University, Montréal.</p></li>
